# census-scraper

This is part of nextLI's scraper that's used to update our indicators. Not every topic has been automated, and none of the analysis has been scripted/automated either.

The `key.py` file has a list of all the indicators we're scraping for this, as well as the categories and location we care about. 

We're also renaming all the columns to slightly more readable formats.
